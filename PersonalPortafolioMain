	A bit about me:
<h3>
	I am a current student who has been speaking English and Spanish since I could talk and I am now learning German.
	My main interest however, is computer science which is what led me to creating this portfolio. I have been coding in Python and HTML for 2 years and I am beginning to learn C++.
	I aspire to one day have a career in coding - maybe Software Developing or data analysis.
